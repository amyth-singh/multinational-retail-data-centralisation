# multinational-retail-data-centralisation

Created a multinational retail data centralisation repo and a readme.md file cloned the repo to local.


In this milestone, multiple sources of data have been extracted, cleaned and then stored in a database. Three .py files were also created called data_cleaning.py, data_extraction.py and database_utils.py with intial classes created within.
